Hi! I'm trying to make quizzes for FFXIV mechanics, similar to cupnoodles.moe. 
The earliest mechanic is Utopian Sky from FRU in patch 7.15.
<br>Want to get started?
<ol>
<li>Scroll down to the bottom of the canvas.</li>
<li>Select your scaling factor. This scaling factor takes effect on reloads, 
and is entirely customizable (unless you want fractions of percentages). The 
recommended scaling factor is 100%. Scaling factor does not affect gameplay 
(but it may lead to sloppy dot positioning).
</li>
<li>Select your mechanic. The later ones (later expansions) are listed at the 
top. Please don't complain if your wanted mechanic isn't available.
</li>
<li>Change your role to whatever role you want.</li>
<li>Start doing the mechanic!</li>
</ol>
